Review the current branch's changes against project conventions before merge.

## Steps

### 1. Gather Context

Read project documentation to understand conventions:
- `CLAUDE.md` — project guide
- `docs/index.md` — agent instructions and coding conventions

### 2. Collect Changes

Get the full picture of what this branch changes:
```
git log main..HEAD --oneline
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git diff main...HEAD
```
If `main` doesn't exist, try `origin/main`.

### 3. Commit Message Audit

Check each commit message:
```
git log main..HEAD --format="%h %s"
```
Verify they are clear, descriptive, and follow the project's conventions.

### 4. Code Review

Review the diff for:
- **Correctness**: Does the logic do what the commit messages claim?
- **Code quality**: Follows existing patterns and conventions?
- **Error handling**: Appropriate for the context?
- **Security**: No credentials, injection risks, or unsafe operations?
- **Tests**: Are changes covered by tests? Are new tests needed?
- **Dead code**: Any leftover debug code, commented-out blocks, or unused imports?

### 5. Documentation Check

- Do changes require README or docs updates?
- Are new functions/commands documented?
- Do existing docs need corrections?

### 6. Issue Cross-Reference

If `issues/` exists, check for related tickets:
- Should any issue status be updated?
- Are there follow-up items to track?

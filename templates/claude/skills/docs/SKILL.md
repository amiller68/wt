# Documentation

Project documentation lives in `docs/`.

## Structure

- `docs/product.md` - What we're building and why
- `docs/contributing.md` - How to contribute
- `CLAUDE.md` or `README.md` - Quick reference

## Finding Information

1. Start with `docs/product.md` for context
2. Check `docs/contributing.md` for technical patterns
3. Check root markdown files for conventions

## Updating Documentation

When you make significant changes, update relevant docs.

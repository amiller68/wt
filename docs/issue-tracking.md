# Issue Tracking

File-based issue tracking for AI agents and contributors.

This is the default convention for projects using `wt`. If your project uses an external tracker like Linear, Jira, or GitHub Issues, you can replace this workflow with your own — the `/issues` command can be adapted to query external tools (e.g., Linear MCP) instead of scanning local files.

## Directory Structure

```
issues/
├── cloud-sync.md               # Epic (high-level overview)
├── cloud-sync-01-sdk-setup.md  # Ticket (specific task)
├── cloud-sync-02-oauth.md
└── ...
```

## Issue Types

### Epics

Large features or initiatives broken into multiple tickets.

- **File naming**: `feature-name.md` (descriptive, no number prefix)
- **Purpose**: High-level overview, context, and architecture decisions
- **Contains**: Background, phases, key technical decisions
- **Links to**: Child tickets for each discrete task

### Tickets

Focused, actionable tasks that can be completed in a single session.

- **File naming**: `feature-NN-short-description.md` (e.g., `cloud-sync-02-oauth.md`)
- **Number prefix**: Suggests execution order within a feature
- **Purpose**: Everything needed to implement one specific task
- **Links to**: Parent epic for full context

## Ticket Format

```markdown
# [Ticket Title]

**Status:** Planned | In Progress | Complete | Blocked
**Epic:** [epic-name.md](./epic-name.md)
**Dependencies:** ticket-01 (if any)

## Objective

One-sentence description of what this ticket accomplishes.

## Implementation Steps

1. Step-by-step guide
2. With specific file paths
3. And code snippets where helpful

## Files to Modify/Create

- `path/to/file` - Description of changes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Checkbox criteria
- [ ] That can be verified

## Verification

How to test that this is working.
```

## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `Planned` | Ready to be worked on |
| `In Progress` | Currently being implemented |
| `Complete` | Done and verified |
| `Blocked` | Waiting on external dependency |

## Picking Up Work

1. Look in `issues/` for tickets with `Status: Planned`
2. Check the parent epic for broader context
3. Verify dependencies are complete before starting
4. Update status to `In Progress` when starting
5. Update status to `Complete` when done

## Creating New Tickets

1. If working on an existing epic, follow its naming pattern
2. For new features, create an epic first if the scope is large
3. Use the ticket format template above

## Dependencies

Tickets can have dependencies in two ways:

1. **Implicit (number order)**: `feature-01` should be done before `feature-02`
2. **Explicit**: Listed in the Dependencies field when non-linear

## Best Practices

- Keep tickets small enough to complete in one session
- Reference specific file paths in implementation steps
- Include code snippets for complex changes
- Always link back to the parent epic
- Update status immediately when starting/finishing work
